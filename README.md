# Fake-Profile-Detection
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict fake profiles on social media platforms. The increasing prevalence of fake accounts has significant implications for trust and security on these platforms. Our model leverages advanced classification techniques to identify and differentiate between real and fake profiles.

Features
Data Collection: Utilizes a dataset of social media profiles with labeled examples of fake and real profiles.
Model Architecture: Implements [specific model] with [mention any specific techniques or architectures used, e.g., deep learning, feature engineering].
Evaluation Metrics: Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results: Provides insights into model performance and effectiveness in detecting fake profiles.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries: [list libraries, e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy]
